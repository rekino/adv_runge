abstract = "We present a type of single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks with sigmoidal nondecreasing activation function. We call them ai-nets. They can approximately interpolate, with arbitrary precision, any set of distinct data in one or several dimensions. They can uniformly approximate any continuous function of one variable and can be used for constructing uniform approximants of continuous functions of several variables. All these capabilities are based on a closed expression of the networks."
